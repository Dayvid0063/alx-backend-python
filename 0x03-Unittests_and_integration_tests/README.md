## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, itâ€™s a real sentence explaining whatâ€™s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures
